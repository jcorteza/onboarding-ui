# onboarding-ui
This simple web page runs on its own server created using Node. [Download Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) if you don't already have it. I recommend the LTS version, which is more stable and widely supported.

In order to run, simply enter `node src/js/main.js` into the terminal while in the root, `onboarding-ui`, directory and follow the [link](http://localhost:9000/). You should see "Hello World" on the page.

Node Version: 10.16.0
