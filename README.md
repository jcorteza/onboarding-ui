## Prerequisites
* This simple web page runs on its own server created using Node. [Download Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) if you don't already have it. I recommend the LTS version, which is more stable and widely supported.
* In order to run, you'll need to [install npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), if you don't already have it installed with Node. To check if you have npm installed, run `npm -v` in your terminal.

## Setting up the project
* Initialize the npm project by running `npm init -y` in your terminal, while in the root of your project directory.
* Then download all the necessary node modules with `npm install`

## Run the project
* Enter `npm run dev` to start your project server and follow the [link](http://localhost:9000/) to view it in a browser.
* You may also enter `npm run hello` to see "Hello World!" logged to the terminal.

Node Version: 10.16.0
